## initially starting with python, c++ (planning to do java, go later, and then rust and c, and then ... planning to go through all these questions

## in iterations with 2 languages but for now we will focus on c++, python).

## planning to go deep in terms of problems then go wide in terms of language

    - for example: we will solve 5 problems from linked in using python
    - in the process say out loud while coding what is happening
    - then after completing in python, go for go, go for java, etc.
    - main thing is we have to explain our thought process out loud, this is very very important, even for easy problem.
    - IF IN ANY STEP, BY ANY STEP, I MEAN EVEN THE LAST LINE OF CODE, IF THE CODE FAILS, OR IF YOU HAD TO SEE A SYNTAX, OR DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT, IF YOU
      SEE THE SOLUTION OR LOOKING FOR SOLUTION, AFTER SEEING THE SOLUTION, YOU HAVE TO REPEAT.
    - YOU HAVE TO REPEAT UNTIL YOU CAN CODE AND EXPLAIN THE SOLUTION WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE ANSWER.

## roadmap currently

- courses -> implement underlying data structures in python, java, c++, go -> do relevant neetcode 150 -> if stuck at a topic, find easy problems or create easy problems through llm and solve it and retry the topic -> study 1 system design school topic and take notes

# !!! SHOULD IMMEDIATELY REVIEW AFTER EACH SESSION OF STUDYING AND PUT THE SCREENSHOTS IN ANKI !!!

# !!! AFTER COMPLETING 7 PROBLEMS, YOU SHOULD HAVE A MOCK INTERVIEW SESSION BASED ON THOSE 7 PROBLEMS. IDEALLY ONCE A WEEK. !!!
